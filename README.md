# Imagify Reddit
Imagify Reddit is a NodeJS web application that displays the most current images & gifs from a user defined subreddit. 

## Website
You can view the project here 
https://imagifyreddit.com

## Getting Started
Begin by installing the required dependencies with the following command
```
npm install
```

Then, start the application by typing
```
node app.js
```

The app is now running locally on your machine. Navigate to localhost on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000) in your favourite browser and you are ready to go.

## Running Tasks
If you are making changes to the front end, you should do so in /src. When you have completed the desired changes run
```
npm run build
```

This will neatly package the css and js into the dist folder.
